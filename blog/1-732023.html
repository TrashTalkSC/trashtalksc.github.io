            <div class="text">Hello everyone! As you can tell, TrashTalk officially has a currently WIP website. This will allow us to release episodes even if YouTube bans us one day.
                <br><br>
                If you want to, you're also able to download the MP3 files off the website so yea. Other than that, things will stay normal as usual. Oh and one more thing, go view the episodes <a href="/episodes.html">by clicking here</a>.
                <br><br>
                One last note, this website existing also means that if Twitter dies, we won't be forced to use only Discord for updates. Very nice to the 3 people (or really one person, me) who don't use Discord and don't wanna join the Discord server.
